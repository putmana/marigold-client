## Marigold Client

A music app for those who want the convenience of streaming with the control of an MP3 player

## Marigold is being rewritten.
#### I am currently rewriting the app from the ground up. My goals in doing so are as follows:
- **Maintainability** - Marigold was originally written quickly, with the goal of getting it ready for a college presentation. As a result, the original code was a little bit... spaghetti.
- **Accessibility** - The rewrite of Marigold will have a focus on semantic HTML, fully featured keyboard navigation, and ALT text for screen reader support
- **Migration to PocketBase** - When I originally created Marigold, I made a large, heavy back-end API using Laravel and MySQL. I'm now moving the app to PocketBase in order to make it more portable.
- **Modularity** - As mentioned before, Marigold was a bit of a spaghetti mess. I'm planning on making the new version much more modular (particularly the SCSS).
- **An Excuse to Use Neovim** - It gives me an excuse to use Neovim and set it up for a SvelteKit/TypeScript development enviornment
